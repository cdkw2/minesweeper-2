# Minesweeper Game
This is a simple text-based Minesweeper game in Python that allows you to play the game in a command-line interface (CLI).

## How to Play
1. Run the script minesweeper.py in your terminal or command prompt.
2. The game will prompt you to enter an action (R for reveal, F for flag) and the coordinates of the cell you want to select (x, y). Example: R 5 3
3. If you choose to reveal a cell, the game will reveal the cell and its adjacent cells. If you choose to flag a cell, the game will place a flag on the cell.

5. If you reveal a mine, the game is over and you lose. If you reveal all non-mine cells, the game is over and you win.
